            About
        </h3>
        <p>Mugs is an immutable collections library for JavaScript that consists of a powerful set of collection prototypes that will make it more natural to write JavaScript programs in a functional manner using features like higher-order functions. By functional programs I'm referring to programs that are referential transparent which it isn't possible to write if you only have mutable collections at your possession.</p>

        <p>The library contains the following collections.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>List</strong> a List contains a sequence of items in the order they were inserted.</li>
            <li><strong>Stack</strong> A stack inserts and retrieves items according to the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle.</li>
            <li><strong>Queue</strong> A queue inserts and retrieves items according to the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle.</li>
            <li><strong>TreeSet</strong> Set contains a sequence of items. The Set has the property that no item may appear twice. </li>
            <li><strong>LLRBSet</strong> a TreeSet based on a Left-Left Red Black Tree</li>
            <li><strong>HashSet</strong> a Set based on hashing</li>
            <li><strong>TreeMap</strong> a map stores items according to a given key.</li>
            <li><strong>LLRBMap</strong> a TreeMap based on a Left-Leaning Red Black Tree</li>
            <li><strong>HashMap</strong> a Map based on hashing</li>
            <li><strong>Multimap</strong> a Multimap is a map where each key is associated with a collection rather than a single item. The user is free to use any of the collections that implements the Extensible interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Random Access List</strong> a Random Access List is a List that supported fast retrieval of items stored at arbitrary positions in the List. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The collections have been developed with the following "interfaces" in mind.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collection</strong> Is the base interface that all collections implements.  </li>
            <li><strong>Extensible</strong> Is a collection with support for insertion and removal of items. </li> 
            <li><strong>Indexed</strong> is a collection where the items can be accessed with an index</li>
            <li><strong>Sequenced</strong> is an collection whose items are stored in a sequence determined but an ordering of the items or the insertion order</li>
            <li><strong>Directed</strong> are for collections that have a sense of direction. This means they support operations like reverse, foldLeft and foldRight (amongst others) that require a sense of direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Map</strong> is a collection that associates a key with a single item.</li>
            <li><strong>Multimap</strong> is a collection that associates a key with a collection of items. The items can be stored in an Extensible collection specified by the user upon construction of the Multimap.</li>
            <li><strong>SortedMap</strong> is a Map where the keys are stored in a sorted order</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following resources have been used to implement the various data structures</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.google.com/books?id=SxPzSTcTalAC&dq=Purely+Functional+Data+Structures&lr=&hl=da&source=gbs_navlinks_s">Purely Functional Data Structures</a> by Chris Okasaki's book has been used to implement the Red Black Tree and Queue</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/LLRB.pdf" target="_blank">Left-leaning Red-Black Trees</a> by Robert Sedgewick has been used to implement the Left-Leaning Red Black Tree</li>

        </p><!-- <p>"Immutable Collections Library for Javascript" is powerful set of immutable collection classes that will make it more natural to write javascript programs in a functional manner using features like higher-order functions.</p>

       <p>The library is written in Coffeescript[1], a small language that compiles to JavaScript, as it adds a few semantics simplifies the code.</p>

            Try it out
        </h3>
        <p>
            You can try out the different collection classes by typing javascript in the textarea below and hitting 'Evaluate' button.
        </p>
        <textarea id="editor">
var list = new mugs.List([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]);

var add = function(x,y) {
    return x + y ;
}

var sum = list.foldLeft(0)( add );

return sum;
</textarea> <button type="submit" id="evaluate">Evaluate</button>
